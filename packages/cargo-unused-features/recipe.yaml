  summary: Detect unused Cargo features in Rust projects
  description: >
    cargo-unused-features is a Cargo subcommand that analyzes
    Rust projects to detect which Cargo features are unused.
    This helps developers clean up feature flags and reduce
    unnecessary compilation overhead.
