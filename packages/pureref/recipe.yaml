  summary: Lightweight reference image organizer for artists
  description: >
    PureRef is a lightweight application that allows artists
    to organize and view reference images on an infinite canvas.

    cluttering the desktop, supporting drag-and-drop, scaling,
    grouping, and layering of images.
