  summary: Terminal-based HTTP/REST client
  description: >
    Slumber is a terminal user interface (TUI) HTTP client designed to define,
    execute, and share configurable HTTP requests. It offers a source-first
    configuration approach, allowing users to easily persist and share request
    templates. Slumber supports importing from external formats like Insomnia,
    building requests dynamically from other requests, files, and shell commands,
    and browsing response data using JSONPath selectors. It also allows switching
    between different environments using profiles.
